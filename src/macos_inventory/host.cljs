  "The probes. nbb. Read-only throughout.

  Two rules hold everywhere here:

  1. **No probe may trigger an authorisation or consent dialog.** A tool that
     fires prompts as it starts teaches the user to click through them. Measured:
     `sfltool dumpbtm` requests `system.privilege.admin` and pops an auth sheet,
     so it is not used at all — login items are read best-effort from the
     BackgroundTaskManagement store instead and reported as `:partial`.
  2. **A probe that cannot see reports that it could not see.** Never an empty
     result that reads as a clean machine."
